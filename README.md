# Computational Research Skills: A case study on scheduling MRI facilities
By Ting Chen, Luuk Gerritsen, Timo Jetten, Georg MÃ¼nstermann.

Case on scheduling MRI facilities for UM Computational Skills course.
Consists of a statistical analysis part and a optimisation part using a discrete event simulation, both programmed in R.

The final versions of the code that are used for the report are

-For Statisctical analysis:
Statistic analysis.R

-For discrete event simulation
New system:
CRS_new_final.R
Old system:
CRS_old_group1.R
CRS_old_group2.R
